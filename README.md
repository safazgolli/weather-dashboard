# weather-dashboard


## discription:

Created a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used  the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, I waited it to activate.


## About the web App:


I get a weather dashboard with form inputs.
If I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
if I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
If I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
if I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city (in progress).
